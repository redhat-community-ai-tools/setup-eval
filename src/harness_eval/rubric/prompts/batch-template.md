Evaluate these {count} components. Return a JSON array with one object per component, in the same order.

{components_section}

{context_section}

## Categories to check:

{categories_section}

## Response format

Respond with a JSON array wrapped in ```json ... ``` fences. One object per component, same order as above.

```json
[
  {{
    "component_name": "name-of-component",
    "issues": [
      {{
        "description": "short description",
        "category": "category_name",
        "severity": "error|warning|info",
        "evidence": "cite specific content",
        "suggestion": "concrete fix",
        "impact": "what will go wrong at runtime"
      }}
    ],
    "summary": "one sentence assessment",
    "verdict": "KEEP|REVIEW|REMOVE"
  }}
]
```

If a component has no issues, return an empty `"issues"` array for it.

VERDICT meanings: KEEP = solid, no significant issues. REVIEW = has issues worth fixing. REMOVE = actively harmful or pure noise.
