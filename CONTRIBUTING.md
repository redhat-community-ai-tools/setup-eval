# How to Contribute

This document explains how to add things to harness-eval: new inspection rules, new future plans, and general contribution guidelines.

## Setup

```bash
cd harness-eval
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Before committing

```bash
uv run ruff format src/ tests/ && uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

All three must pass. Commits that fail `ruff check` or `ruff format` will be rejected by pre-commit hooks.

Pre-commit also runs **gitleaks** (secret scanning) and **bandit** (Python security analysis). If gitleaks blocks your commit, you likely have a hardcoded credential or API key that needs to be moved to an environment variable.

## Before pushing

Pre-push hooks run the full test suite and two dogfood gates:

```bash
uv run harness-eval security . --fail-on-warning   # any security finding blocks
uv run harness-eval lint . --fail-on-error          # only structural errors block
```

The security gate is strict: even a warning about credential access patterns blocks the push. The lint gate is lenient: quality/style warnings are advisory, only real errors (broken references, missing descriptions) block.

## Versioned data files

Knowledge that decays over time (built-in command lists, tautological pattern definitions) lives in `src/harness_eval/data/` as JSON files. Edit these when Claude Code adds new built-in commands or when model defaults change. No code changes needed.

## Adding a new inspection rule

A rule is a Python class that checks one specific thing about one component type. Each rule lives in its own file.

### 1. Create the rule file

Rules go in `src/harness_eval/inspection/rules/<category>/`. Pick the category that matches what you're checking:

| Category | What it checks | Target type |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `structural/` | File existence | Skill |
| `frontmatter/` | YAML metadata quality | Skill |
| `content/` | Body content (duplicates, references, budget) | Skill |
| `quality/` | Instruction effectiveness (hedging, redundancy, placeholders) | Skill |
| `security/` | Credential access, prompt injection | Skill |
| `commands/` | Command-specific checks | Command |
| `claude_md/` | System instruction checks (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules) | CLAUDE_MD |
| `mcp/` | MCP configuration validation | MCP_CONFIG |
| `hooks/` | Hook structure, safety, and script boundary | Hooks |
| `agents/` | Agent definition checks | Agent |

### 2. Follow the pattern

Every rule has the same shape. Here's the minimal template:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from harness_eval.core.types import ComponentType
from harness_eval.inspection.types import (
    Location,
    ReportDescriptor,
    RuleCategory,
    RuleContext,
    RuleMeta,
    Severity,
)


class MyNewRule:
    meta = RuleMeta(
        id="category/rule-name",          # unique, kebab-case
        default_severity=Severity.WARNING, # or ERROR, INFO
        fixable=False,
        description="One sentence about what this checks",
        category=RuleCategory.CONTENT,     # match the folder
        messages={
            "message_id": "What to tell the user: {{variable}}",
        },
        target_type=ComponentType.SKILL,   # what component this applies to
        tools=None,                        # None = all tools; ("claude",) = Claude Code only; ("cursor",) = Cursor only
    )

    def create(self, context: RuleContext) -> None:
        # Access the component via context.skill, context.command,
        # context.claude_md, context.hooks, or context.agent
        # Use context.source_tool ("claude", "cursor", or None) for tool-specific behavior
        skill = context.skill
        if not skill.raw_content:
            return

        # Check something, report if it fails
        if some_condition:
            context.report(ReportDescriptor(
                message_id="message_id",
                data={"variable": "value"},
                location=Location(file=skill.skill_md_path, start_line=1),
            ))
```

Look at existing rules for real examples. `commands/shadows_builtin.py` is a simple one. `security/no_prompt_injection.py` is a complex one.

### 3. Register the rule

Add your class to `src/harness_eval/inspection/rules/__init__.py`:

1. Add the import (alphabetical within its section)
2. Add the class to the `for rule_cls in [...]` list

### 4. Update the counts

Update the rule count in all files that reference it:
- `README.md` (the "Inspection Rules (N)" heading, table, and command table)
- `CLAUDE.md` (the project structure line mentioning rule count)
- `src/harness_eval/cli.py` (the `harness_eval_lint` docstring)
- `skills/lint/SKILL.md` (the description field)
- `skills/review/report-format.md` (the lint description)
- `commands/lint.md` (the description field)
- `.cursor/commands/lint.md` (the description)
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (the plugin description)

### 5. Add tests

At minimum, add to `tests/`:
- One test where the rule fires
- One test where it doesn't fire on clean input

### 6. Cross-component state

If your rule needs to compare across components (like duplicate detection compares all skills to each other), use `context.scan_state` instead of module-level variables:

```python
STATE_KEY = "my-rule/state"

def create(self, context: RuleContext) -> None:
    if STATE_KEY not in context.scan_state:
        context.scan_state[STATE_KEY] = {"seen": {}}
    state = context.scan_state[STATE_KEY]
    # use state instead of module-level dicts
```

## Adding support for a new AI assistant

The discovery layer uses per-tool discoverer classes in `src/harness_eval/core/discoverers/`. To add a new assistant:

### 1. Create a discoverer class

Create `src/harness_eval/core/discoverers/my_tool.py` that subclasses `ToolDiscoverer` from `base.py`. Implement:
- `tool_name` (display name, e.g., "My Tool")
- `source_tool` (short identifier for `ParsedComponent.source_tool`, e.g., "mytool")
- `detect(root)` (return True if the tool's files exist)
- `discover(root)` (return list of `ParsedComponent` objects)
- `collect_paths(root)` (return list of file paths for watch mode)

Use `parse_file()` from `base.py` to create components. Map files to existing `ComponentType` values (SKILL, COMMAND, AGENT, CLAUDE_MD, HOOKS, MCP_CONFIG).

### 2. Register the discoverer

Add your class to `src/harness_eval/core/discoverers/registry.py` in the `DISCOVERERS` list.

### 3. Add fingerprint patterns

Add the tool's file patterns to `RELEVANT_PATTERNS` in `src/harness_eval/core/fingerprint.py`.

### 4. Add test fixtures

Create `tests/fixtures/sample-mytool-setup/` with representative config files and write tests verifying discovery, source_tool attribution, and tool detection.

## Proposing new features

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redhat-community-ai-tools/harness-eval/issues) describing the problem and proposed solution. Feature discussions happen on issues, not in the codebase.

## PR guidelines

- One logical change per PR.
- Run `uv run ruff format src/ tests/ && uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run pytest tests/ -q` before committing.
- PR title should describe what changed, not how (e.g., "Add shadows-builtin rule" not "Add new file and update init").
- If adding a rule, include the test in the same PR.

## Project conventions

- **Python:** 3.11+, managed with `uv`
- **Linting:** ruff (select E, F, I, UP, B, SIM)
- **Type checking:** mypy strict
- **Data classes:** frozen dataclasses for domain objects, Pydantic for config
- **CLI:** Click command groups
- **Tests:** pytest, fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
- **Line length:** 100 characters
